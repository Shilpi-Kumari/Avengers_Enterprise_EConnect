## Project Introduction<br>

EConnect is enterprise application which is mainly used for professional networking. The main purpose of the application is to allow job seekers to manage their network and help them to get back to workforce. It is a web application which helps in finding out available/vacant jobs for jobseekers to connect with recruiters. This helps in recruiters/employers to find out the best profile. In order to meet objectives of recruiters and job consultancies, EConnect will be very helpful. We have followed traditional way of recruitment such as University job fairs, newspapers, televisions, referrals and so on. With the increase in internet usage, EConnect brings out the easiest approach for job seekers and recruiters to find and post their jobs.
